	<p><h4>Breaking Benjamin is a post-grunge/alternative metal band Formed in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, USA in 1998 by vocalist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel, Breaking Benjamin quickly garnered a strong local following. </h4> </p>
<p><h4>In September of 2004, drummer, and founding member of Breaking Benjamin, Jeremy Hummel was relieved of his duties in the band. Subsequently, on September 28, 2005, Hummel filed a federal lawsuit against the remaining members of Breaking Benjamin, as well as its management, claiming he was not paid for songs he helped write. Hummel’s lawsuit asked for more than $8 million in damages. A message was released October 25, 2006 on the bands official website stating that the band and Hummel had come to agreement on the lawsuit.</h4> </p>
<p><h4>On March 4, 2007, HDNet premiered a one-hour show of the Breaking Benjamin concert in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania at Stabler Arena. This is also the concert that was included on the Phobia re-release DVD in April of 2007, advertised as “The Homecoming”. Footage of the band’s live Stabler Arena performance of “Breath” comprises the song’s music video.</h4> </p>
<p><h4>On April 17, 2007, Breaking Benjamin re-released the album Phobia. The album featured a DVD with about an hour of their Stabler Arena concert footage.
</h4> </p>
<p><h4>Certain copies of Dear Agony purchased at Best Buy also come with a bonus DVD that includes the band’s six music videos including a previously-unreleased version of the video for “I Will Not Bow”. The version on the DVD is of the band only and does not contain any footage from the movie Surrogates, unlike the version released on the Internet.</h4> </p>
<p><h4>On August 31st, 2009, prior to the release of Dear Agony, Breaking Benjamin released their first single from DA, “I Will Not Bow”. It was featured in the 2009 Sci-Fi film [Starring Bruce Willis], “Surrogates”. The song was not written specifically for the film, but according to drummer Chad Szeliga, “Ben sent a few songs to our record label, Hollywood Records,” which is owned by Disney, who then decided they “wanted a Breaking Benjamin song for this movie.”</h4> </p>
<p><h4>The music video for I Will Not Bow was released to the band’s Myspace on August 21, 2009. The video was shot at the World Trade Center building 7, but has no connection or significant meaning having to do with the 9/11 events as stated by Aaron Fink in his Point interview on August 13, 2009. The video was directed by Rich Lee who has also directed for Evanescence. Lee chose the location, feeling it was an eerie place to film.</h4> </p>
<p><h4>A second version of the music video without the Surrogates footage was released with the Best Buy Exclusive version of Dear Agony. It includes various bridged footage of the band performing.
</h4> </p>
<p><h4>On January 5, 2010, Give Me a Sign was the second single released from Breaking Benjamin’s fourth studio album, Dear Agony.</h4> </p>
