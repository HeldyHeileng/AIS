<p><h4>Saturate is the debut album by American post-grunge/alternative metal band Breaking Benjamin. It was released on August 5, 2002 through Hollywood Records, and featured the singles "Polyamorous" and "Skin". There was a dispute between the band and the studio on deciding on which they wanted to release as singles. The band wished for their song "Forever", while the studio insisted on releasing "Skin" as a single. Eventually, the band decided to go with "Skin", despite some negative feedback with the band and the fairly poor success it reached. The original release of Saturate contained "Forever" as a separate track, whereas the newer enhanced versions came with the "Polyamorous" music video and featured the song embedded with "Shallow Bay". The album title is derived from a lyric in the song, "Wish I May". On September 14, 2002, Saturate peaked on the Billboard 200 and Heatseekers charts at #136 and #2, respectively. There were also plans for a European release of the album containing the song "Lady Bug" and the Depeche Mode cover "Enjoy the Silence" but was never released.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Phobia is the third studio album by American post-grunge/alternative metal band Breaking Benjamin. It was recorded at The Barbershop Studios in Hopatcong, New Jersey and released August 8, 2006 through Hollywood Records. Phobia was released on August 8, 2006 and quickly sold out at major retail chains such as Best Buy and Target. The album sold 131,000 copies in its first week, which made it the fastest selling and highest charting Breaking Benjamin album to date, hitting #2 on the US Billboard Top 200. This is the first studio album Chad Szeliga recorded with the band. The intro track features the sound effects of an airport, namely a flight attendant announcing standard safety procedures and the sound of an airplane making its ascent, alluding to Benjamin Burnley's fear of flying, hence the inspiration for the album name, Phobia.

The album reentered the Billboard 200 at number 38 on May 5, 2007 with its reissue. On May 21, 2009, the album was certified platinum by the RIAA.
The CD released with the Phobia Collector's Edition DVD also includes this track.

<p><h4>Breaking Benjamin began writing for Dear Agony during 2008. The recording process began in September, leading to its release one year later. The cover of the album is an MRI scan of frontman Benjamin Burnley's head. Burnley has cited Dear Agony as the first album he has written sober. After the album's release it entered the Billboard 200 Chart at #4 selling roughly 134,000 copies in its first week, slightly more than Phobia. It also topped the iTunes download charts in the first week of its release. As of February 16, 2010, "Dear Agony" has been certified Gold by the RIAA and sold over 700,000 copies. "Lights Out" was used to promote the game Halo: Reach. On September 23, 2009, Breaking Benjamin released an online browser game constructed from Adobe Flash which is a parody of Altered Beast, aptly titled "Altered Benjamin". The game contains three levels and plays the same as the original, except the player controls vocalist Benjamin Burnley and the three bosses are each other member of the band respectively. The game also features the debut of the songs "Fade Away" and "Crawl".
