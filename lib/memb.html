<p><h1>Benjamin Burnley</h1></p>
<p><h4>Benjamin Burnley was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and partially grew up in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. At the age of 18, he dropped out of high school and moved to Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania and became a room-mate of former Breaking Benjamin bass player Jonathan Price. He then taught himself to play guitar by listening to Nirvana’s Nevermind and has also claimed that Nirvana was his biggest influence. Before Breaking Benjamin was formed, Burnley had earned money by playing cover songs in various coffee houses as a solo artist under his own name “Benjamin.” He later came up with the band’s name, “Breaking Benjamin,” after doing a performance of a Nirvana cover, Ben knocked over (to imitate his lifelong idol Kurt Cobain) and cracked a microphone he had borrowed. The owner of the microphone walked onto the stage and said, “I’d like to thank Benjamin for breaking my microphone.”</h4></p>

<p><h4>Burnley is victim to several phobias and has even said that the name of their 2006 album, Phobia, was named after that simple fact. The cover of Phobia depicts a man with wings hovering above the ground, which is a representation of Burnley’s most notable fear, being that of flying. This fear of flying is the reason that Breaking Benjamin never tours outside of the United States and Canada.</h4></p>
<p><h4>Burnley is a self admitted video gamer. In fact, he maintained the idea for Breaking Bejamin to write and record the song “Blow Me Away” for the soundtrack to Halo 2. The song “Polyamorous” is also featured on the game Run Like Hell , WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw and WWE Day of Reckoning (also with their song “Firefly”), and “The Diary of Jane” was also featured on NASCAR 07 the video game.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Burnley is a former alcoholic, admitting in an interview with listenin.org that he wanted to “drink himself to death.” He has been diagnosed with Wernicke’s encephalopathy due to the alcohol consumption. He says that he regrets ever drinking a drop of alcohol and continues to suffer from lingering problems. He is named after his grandfather Benjamin Jackson Burnley Jr.</h4></p>

<p><h1>Jeremy Hummel</h1></p>
<p><h4> Jeremy Hummel (born December 8, 1973) is the former drummer of the rock band Breaking Benjamin. He co-wrote and recorded their debut album, Saturate, as well as the follow-up platinum album, We Are Not Alone. He was also on the EP "So Cold", which contains an acoustic version of the title track as well as 2 previously unreleased studio tracks; 'Blow Me Away' & 'LadyBug'. The latter of which is a fan favorite from the band's years of playing in and around their home-town of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. There are also 2 live tracks recorded in Allentown, Pennsylvania which were not recorded with Hummel. Both are from the 'We Are Not Alone' album. The "So Cold" EP was released on a national level in November 2004.The sales were notable nationally. The EP is now out-of-print. </p>
</p></h4>
<p><h4>
In September 2004, after the recording of We Are Not Alone, while on approximately 6 weeks of paternity leave for the birth of his first child, Hummel was relieved of his duties in the band. Benjamin Burnley, vocalist and co-founder of Breaking Benjamin, called Hummel on September 7, 5 days after the birth of Hummel's son Julian, to tell him he was being replaced. Burnley has stated that there was a chemistry issue. Subsequently, on September 28, 2005, Hummel filed an 11 count federal lawsuit against the remaining members of Breaking Benjamin, as well as its management, claiming he was not paid for songs he helped write. The suit was settled for an undisclosed amount.
</p></h4>
<p><h4>
Hummel continues his career as an independent artist, doing studio work, instructing, and writing for Modern Drummer magazine. He is composing and playing with Sunbury rock cover group Into the Spin. Hummel is also a member of the ambient/acid-jazz band Electric Volcano Experiment with guitarist Alex Callenberger and bassist Andy Seal. He also performs with various artists including Bret Alexander of Saturation Acres. Hummel and Alexander are also currently co-producing Evolution of Sound, the first EP album by Harrisburg band Drop of Grey. In 2012, Jeremy became an online drum lesson instructor for YourMusicMuse.com.

<p><h1>Aaron Fincke</p></h1>
<p><h4>
Aaron Fincke (born April 22, 1978) (known professionally as "Aaron Fink") is an American guitarist, best known as the former lead guitarist for the post-grunge/alternative metal band Breaking Benjamin and now the current guitarist of the band Stardog Champion.
</p></h4>
<p><h4>
Before Breaking Benjamin, Aaron Fink and bandmate Mark James Klepaski (bass), were members of the band Lifer (Strangers With Candy). They broke away from Lifer in late 2001, in a surprising blind leap of faith to join their old high school friend Ben Burnley (vocals/guitar) and Jeremy Hummel (former drummer) in creating Breaking Benjamin. Fink has helped Burnley write many of the band's lyrics and was a strong backbone of the band. He is known as an expressive guitarist with a flair for both color and crunch. Ben has stated the following about Aaron's work on the band's second album, We Are Not Alone, "He's not so much a riff guy as someone who creates atmosphere. His talents really shine through here."
</p></h4>
<p><h4>
In live performances, Fink currently plays Music Man/Ernie Ball Axis Super Sport Guitars. He used to play his Washburn Idol guitar for live performances, and a Fender Telecaster in earlier years, but has started to play MusicMan instead. He also pulls out his PRS for a few songs in the live set.

<p><h4>
On August 2, 2011, an article was released regarding a dispute over a new recording of the band's hit song "Blow Me Away". The dispute erupted in May when lead singer Benjamin Burnley fired the bandmates, guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski, via e-mail. Burnley detailed his side of the dispute in a June court filing, saying Fink and Klepaski made unilateral and unauthorized decisions on behalf of the band, including giving permission in May for the new recording and remix of "Blow Me Away" without his consent. Since being fired from Breaking Benjamin, Aaron has formed a new band called Stardog Champion with bassist and fellow ex Breaking Benjamin member Mark Klepaski, vocalist and rhythm guitarist Nick Coyle and drummer Josh Karis. The group released their first digital 5 song EP titled "Exhale" which contains their debut single "When We Fall" on April 23, 2013.
