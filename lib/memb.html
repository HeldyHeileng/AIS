<p><h1>Benjamin Burnley</h1></p>
<p><h4>Benjamin Burnley was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and partially grew up in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. At the age of 18, he dropped out of high school and moved to Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania and became a room-mate of former Breaking Benjamin bass player Jonathan Price. He then taught himself to play guitar by listening to Nirvana’s Nevermind and has also claimed that Nirvana was his biggest influence. Before Breaking Benjamin was formed, Burnley had earned money by playing cover songs in various coffee houses as a solo artist under his own name “Benjamin.” He later came up with the band’s name, “Breaking Benjamin,” after doing a performance of a Nirvana cover, Ben knocked over (to imitate his lifelong idol Kurt Cobain) and cracked a microphone he had borrowed. The owner of the microphone walked onto the stage and said, “I’d like to thank Benjamin for breaking my microphone.”</h4></p>

<p><h4>Burnley is victim to several phobias and has even said that the name of their 2006 album, Phobia, was named after that simple fact. The cover of Phobia depicts a man with wings hovering above the ground, which is a representation of Burnley’s most notable fear, being that of flying. This fear of flying is the reason that Breaking Benjamin never tours outside of the United States and Canada.</h4></p>
<p><h4>Burnley is a self admitted video gamer. In fact, he maintained the idea for Breaking Bejamin to write and record the song “Blow Me Away” for the soundtrack to Halo 2. The song “Polyamorous” is also featured on the game Run Like Hell , WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw and WWE Day of Reckoning (also with their song “Firefly”), and “The Diary of Jane” was also featured on NASCAR 07 the video game.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Burnley is a former alcoholic, admitting in an interview with listenin.org that he wanted to “drink himself to death.” He has been diagnosed with Wernicke’s encephalopathy due to the alcohol consumption. He says that he regrets ever drinking a drop of alcohol and continues to suffer from lingering problems. He is named after his grandfather Benjamin Jackson Burnley Jr.</h4></p>
